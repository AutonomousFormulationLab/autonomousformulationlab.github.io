                <h2>Program Overview</h2>
                <p>The Autonomous Formulation Laboratory is a joint program between the nSoft consortium, NCNR, and NIST's Materials Measurement Lab focused on accelerating materials discovery and formulation optimization through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) directed, multimodal scattering experiments.</p>
                
                <p>The core of the AFL platform is an open source, NCNR-developed platform to prepare liquid mixtures via pipetting, transfer those mixtures to a measurement cell, perform a SANS (or SAXS or other method) experiment, and provide the data to an AI guidance server.</p>
                
                <p>Formulation engineering is at the core of soft materials-based products that cut across industry and everyday life: paints, vaccines, fuels, and shampoos are just a few examples of products that are formulated with tens to hundreds of individual components.</p>
